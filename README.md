# DRONE CONTROLLER Unity3D

This repo contains a unity3D environment to demonstrate drone controller physics. It is made using unity new Input System. 

### Goal
1. Adding Unity ML Agent to teach the flying mechanism
2. Pathfinding Algorithm for navigation
3. Target based reward and searching inside the Environment


# This is repo is opened for all to reuse in their projects and anyone interested to contribute to my research on Reinforcement Learning and Cognitive Science, you can contact me. My mail id: gunjan.mtbpaul@gmail.com
